Libraries used:
NumPy 1.22.3
matplotlib 3.5.1
OpenCV 4.5.5

As I mentioned on my report this program is not complete and correct. 
If you simply run the code it will work untill RANSAC can not find a homography matrix.
When you run the code, it will start stitching images from number 05 to 32. 
I will also provide those images with the code. 
Thank you for your time.
